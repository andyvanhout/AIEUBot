AIEU Bot

I have no idea what I'm doing.

Something something MIT license.

Something something npm install

Pretty sure it uses "discordjs" library along with "enmap."  Enmap requires more stuff like better-sql to make work good but Hoots isn't there yet.

Much like no have candle, you can no have my settings.json file. Make your own bot. But it needs to be configured like this:

{
    "token": "<yourtokenhere>",
    "prefix": "<putaprefixhere>"
}

Much of the bot, particularly the command handler, was shamelessly stolen from following the tutorial at https://anidiots.guide/.

I tore the code apart and broke it to figure out how it works, but I'll still leave comments in the when I make the repo public to show where I have no idea what's going on and where dark Javascript magic is happening.

Maybe I'll improved this readme some day.
